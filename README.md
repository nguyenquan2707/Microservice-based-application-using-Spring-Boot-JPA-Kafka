# POS (Point of sale)
Designed and developed a simple micro-service based POS application using spring  boot framework with JPA and Kafka for message queue  processing and MySQL for database storage. There are three micro-services - customer, sales and inventory. Customer micro-service is for 
registering new customer and their total sale. Inventory micro-service is for inventory management of products. Sales micro-service is for processing of order made by the customers. Synchronization between the micro-services are done using Kafka.
